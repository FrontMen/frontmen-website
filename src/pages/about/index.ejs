    <p>FrontMen was established in 2012. It has since grown to a company of almost 100 enthusiastic developers and architects. Professionals
        working in small teams at (and with) our clients to create the best frontend applications based on the latest JavaScript
        standards. With us, the app in itself is never the end goal. We deliver something that lasts longer: the power and the
        tools to innovate faster and better in the future.</p>
    
    <p>In 2012 FrontMen was founded to bring together passionate software engineers with the shared believe that
        JavaScript would become the dominant development language powering the frontend of applications and only
        organizations using this new wave of technologies best were in favour to succeed.</p>
    <p>The story became true. And will become even more. We started with a small team of senior frontend experts,
        building apps and implementing a modern stack for early adopting clients. Today, we set standards and realize
        application environments that secure our clients can deliver-fast, meet new requirements and answer the
        increasing expectations of their users every day.</p>

    <h3>Frontend Component Library</h3>

    </figure>

    <p>Even after the (web) app has been delivered, it is crucial for your organization to be able to implement new functionality quickly, all the while preserving the quality of the code. That’s why, for large projects, we put together a Components Library containing all bits and pieces of code. This allows you to create high-quality software independently, at any time, and to significantly reduce the time it takes to get from idea to end product.</p>
    <h3>Always learning/developing</h3>
    <p>Knowledge development is central to our company. There is no leaning back when you’re a front-runner in a hyper-dynamic branch.
        We organize workshops, congresses and meet-ups to bring our own developers, clients and the growing frontend community
        in the Netherlands up to speed with the latest developments.</p>
    <h3>100% Agile</h3>
    <p>Our agile method enables us to be fast and flexible in finding the very best solutions together with our clients. We work in three-week sprints. After this short period we deliver a working component, which we make available to the end user to take for a test ride. The feedback is then used to make improvements.</p>
